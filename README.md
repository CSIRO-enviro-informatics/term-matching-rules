# term-matching-rules
This repository contains Python functions to match a given term from a data web service's metadata to controlled lists of terms.

The purpose of this repository's work is to allow the often poorly documented data available from sources such as field equiptment (e.g. weatherstations) made available via web APIs to be better understood. Often the data does have some sort of metadata, such as variable names, but no units of measure or rigour in the variable naming.
